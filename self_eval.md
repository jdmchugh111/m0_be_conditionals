# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? when you're trying to output and if/then statement, even if there's multiple possible "then" outcomes
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? remember to git add before trying to git commit
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? being able to succesfully code a multiple line conditional with elsif statements - felt good because I was struggling a bit with those during the lesson
